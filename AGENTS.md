# Agent Notes

This repository uses this file to share context between contributors.

## Guidelines
- After completing a task, append a short bullet under **Log** with the date, your name or handle, and a concise description of your changes or ideas for future work.
- Keep notes brief so they are easy to scan.
- Add new bullets to the bottom of the list to maintain order.

## Creating New Tic Tac Toe Variants
Follow these steps when adding a new variant to the collection:

1. **Study the current layout** – each game lives in its own `tic-tac-*.html` file. These pages use Tailwind CSS via CDN and inline JavaScript for the game logic.
2. **Copy an existing page** – `tic-tac-classic.html` is a good starting template. Keep the overall structure and styling consistent.
3. **Keep the style unified** – reuse classes from `style.css` and follow the same header, board and button look so all variants feel part of the same site.
4. **Add your page to `index.html`** – duplicate one of the `<div class="game-card">` blocks and update the title, description and link.
5. **Run `npm test`** – ensure existing tests pass before committing.
6. **Update the variant lists below** – add your new page under **Existing Variants** and remove it from **Proposed Variants** if it was previously listed.
