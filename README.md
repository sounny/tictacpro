# Tic Tac Pro

Welcome to Tic Tac Pro! This project is a collection of creative and unique versions of the classic Tic Tac Toe game. Our goal is to explore different mechanics and twists on this timeless game, offering a variety of challenges and fun.

## Games

Currently, Tic Tac Pro features the following games:

*   **Classic Tic Tac Toe**: The original game of X's and O's.
*   **Tic Tac Decay**: A version where your oldest move disappears, adding a new layer of strategy.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! If you have an idea for a new and interesting version of Tic Tac Toe, we'd love to see it.

To contribute:

1.  **Fork** this repository.
2.  **Create a new HTML file** for your game (e.g., `my-cool-tictactoe.html`).
3.  **Implement your game** using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
    *   Feel free to use any libraries or frameworks you prefer (e.g., Tailwind CSS, React, Vue, Svelte).
    *   Ensure your game is playable and reasonably styled.
4.  **Add a game card** for your new version to `index.html`.
    *   Include a brief description and a "Play" button linking to your game's HTML file.
    *   You can use a placeholder SVG for the preview icon initially, or create a custom one.
5.  **Update the `style.css`** if necessary to ensure your new game card fits in with the existing design.
6.  **Submit a Pull Request** with your changes.

We're excited to see what creative Tic Tac Toe variations the community can come up with!
