**Play the game collection live at: [https://sounny.github.io/tictacpro/](https://sounny.github.io/tictacpro/)**

## About This Project

This project aims to explore different ways to play the simple game of Tic Tac Toe, introducing new rules, mechanics, and challenges to make it more engaging and fun. Each game is implemented as a standalone HTML page with its own JavaScript logic.

## Game Variations

Here are the Tic Tac Toe variations currently available:

*   **Tic Tac Classic (`classic.html`)**
    *   The timeless game of X's and O's on a 3x3 grid. Supports 2-player and vs-Computer modes.

*   **Tic-Tac-Decay (`tic-tac-decay.html`)**
    *   A challenging twist where your oldest piece disappears if you have more than 3 pieces on the board! Think ahead to win.

*   **Tic-Tac-Swap (`tic-tac-swap.html`)**
    *   A mind-bending version where, once per game, you can swap any two pieces on the board! Outmaneuver your opponent with strategic swaps.

*   **Tic-Tac-Gravity (`tic-tac-gravity.html`)**
    *   Experience Tic Tac Toe with a twist! Pieces fall to the lowest available spot in a column, changing your strategy entirely.

*   **Tic-Tac-Push (`tic-tac-push.html`)**
    *   A dynamic Tic Tac Toe where placing your piece can push your opponent's adjacent pieces into an empty space behind them. Strategic shoves win the day.

*   **Tic-Tac-Bomb (`tic-tac-bomb.html`)**
    *   Strategically clear sections of the board! Each player gets one bomb per game to detonate a 3x3 area. Use it wisely!

*   **Tic Tac Four (`tic-tac-four.html`)**
    *   A bigger challenge! Play on a 4x4 grid and be the first to get four of your marks in a row.

*   **Tic Tac Toroid (`tic-tac-toroid.html`)**
    *   A toroidal board where lines wrap around the edges for unexpected winning combinations.
